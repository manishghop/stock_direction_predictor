In getdata file we are creating a table data and storing the values from the dataset
also we are creating a dataset table to store 3 fields that we are using for prediction 
along with profit/loss. 
Then in prediction file we use bernoulie naive bayes algorithm to perform a binary 
classification, load the data from the data set that we created(dynamically) and 
based on the details of user input match for the similiar data point in dataset
give result.
